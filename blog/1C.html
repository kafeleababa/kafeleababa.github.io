            <h3 class="cardTitle">Describe your core personal values</h3>
            <p>
                Exploring my values has been quite a journey, as I often find it tough to
                annotate my thoughts. My parents are the driving force behind many of my
                values as they are both very strong willed, hard working and honest, but
                can also be mulish. This is something myself and my 3 sisters share in
                differing quantities. My core values include discipline, honesty,
                politeness, hard work, empathy and seeing the best in others. I was raised
                to always "Treat others how you would like to be treated " and I believe
                that is the reason that I am the man I am today.
            </p>
            <p>7 years in the military
                also help shape the way I operate, reinforce my values and also introduce
                new ones. The military's core values of Courage, Commitment, Comradeship
                and Integrity were impressed upon me in varying ways throughout my career.
                Having the courage and commitment to leave home for 6 months at a time,
                the comradeship to treat those around me like family regardless of whether
                we liked it or not, finally the integrity complete all tasks required to
                the best of my ability. These traits will stay with me for the rest of my
                life, not only because I lived and breathed them every day but because I
                saw first hand how effective they were to making a well rounded and fully
                functioning team.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to explore my identity and values further I took the Myers-Briggs
                test and came away with Virtuoso (ISTP), after digesting the reading I
                completely agree with around 90% of the traits and qualities described,
                the other 10% I find that I often embody a different trait. I am an
                Extrovert around friends and family but an Introvert around new people. I
                often spend more time thinking before making a choice but I also often act
                on Impulse. ISTPs are touted to become mechanics or engineers, Often
                struggling with academic work they prefer to get stuck in with hands on
                learning. </p>
            <p></p>I have found this to be true and the exercises based on
            reflection I have struggled with as it all comes from within. However, not
            one to shy away from a challenge I wanted to dive deeper into the topic, I
            took the premise of the DOPE Personality test, created a spreadsheet
            questionnaire and sent it to my friends and family. I asked them to fill
            the in the questionnaire and the results were interesting to say the
            least! Comparing them to the answers I chose for myself I came away with a
            higher appreciation for the courage and honesty in the feedback I
            received.

                Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
            </h3>

            <p>
                Deciding to leave the military was a big decision. Deciding to leave the
                comfort of a stable career to pursue opportunities in the wider world was
                scary for quite some time. Im still left with apprehension as I approach
                life as a full time student for the first time since college. I chose to
                leave as I couldn't see my career progression aligning with my goals for
                my future. I found that day to day I wasn't enjoying the work but because
                I was still getting paid I stayed ! This caused a rift between my want to
                remain comfortable and being honest with myself. After deciding to leave I
                was faced with a second decision, I knew that becoming a Developer was my
                next career path but which way would I choose to get there?
            </p>
            <p>I tossed up between university, bootcamp or self taught. While University is the
                traditional path and would provide opportunities to develop critical
                thinking methods required for the degree, a good knowledge base and a
                qualification which would be acknowledged far and wide, I didn't feel that
                it suited the way I learn. Deciding against becoming a self taught
                developer was also an easy choice.
            </p>
            <p>It would give me the freedom to study the way I wanted and be as hands on as I could, but I still feel
                the need
                for a structured. As disciplined as I am, academic work has always been
                something that I have struggled with and I feel that it ultimately
                wouldn't have worked out. The final option I regarded, much to the dismay
                of my father, a University Professor and career academic, was Dev Academy.
                Choosing this course was, for me, the best of both worlds. Hands on and
                structured, while also having a focus on introducing me to the real world
                dynamic of being a developer. There is also a large focus in developing
                the soft skills that many people in all industries lack, yet need more
                than ever.

            <h3 class="cardTitle">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h3>

            <p>
                Growing up in New Zealand has definitely influenced the way I approach the
                world and the people in it. New Zealanders are mostly a happy and diverse
                bunch, and they are the qualities that I resonate with. Throughout my
                childhood we always had a full house, whether is was family or friends,
                the happiest memories I have are from parties, gatherings or just being
                around people. From that to the teamwork focussed culture of the military,
                I thrive in group situations and feel that I work best in when presented
                with a task that requires input from others. Having two very hard working
                and strong willed parents has shown me the value of both qualities,
                without a shadow of a doubt. I have never been content with sitting around
                and letting opportunities pass by without at least giving it a try. This
                is what drove me to having 3 part time jobs by the time I was 18.

            <p>
                Choosing my next career path was something I spent most of 2020 mulling
                over, I have been a qualified Personal Trainer for several years and have
                always had a passion for health and fitness. On the flip side, I have had
                a passion for technology since a very young age. I have an analytical mind
                which serves me well when approaching problems but I am limited by my
                selective attention span.
            </p>
            <p>If I am doing something I enjoy, I will happily
                let the day go by but if not, it might take a week. Deciding to study and
                become a Web Developer better suited my long term goals of being able to
                travel and work from essentially anywhere in the world and it also matched
                my skill set. Health and Fitness will always be a part of my life and with
                the world heading in the technology reliant direction im sure i'll be able
                to better integrate Personal Training into my future.

            <p>
                During my years in the military I developed my soft skills, mental
                flexibility and management skills. These strengths make me a good fit for
                any team based work. In approaching this new learning journey there have
                already been times where my persistence on pursuing certain topics has put
                me behind which triggers my competitive spirit. I normally seek feedback
                on the work I do but I often find it difficult to take constructive
                criticism and turn it into something positive, which is something I have
                committed to working on.
