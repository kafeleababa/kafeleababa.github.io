      <h3><b>My Identity and values.</b></h3>
      <h4 class="cardtitle">Describe your core personal values</h4>
      <p>Exploring my values has been quite a journey, as I often find it tough to annotate my thoughts. My parents are the driving force behind many of my values as they are both very strong willed, hard working and honest, but can also be mulish. This is something myself and my 3 sisters share in differing quantities. My core values include discipline, honesty, politeness, hard work, empathy and seeing the best in others. I was raised to always "Treat others how you would like to be treated" and I believe that is the reason that I am the man I am today. 7 years in the military also help shape the way I operate, reinforce my values and also introduce new ones. The military's core values of Courage, Commitment, Comradeship and Integrity were impressed upon me in varying ways throughout my career. Having the courage and commitment to leave home for 6 months at a time, the comradeship to treat those around me like family regardless of whether we liked it or not, finally the integrity complete all tasks required to the best of my ability. These traits will stay with me for the rest of my life, not only because I lived and breathed them every day but because I saw first hand how effective they were to making a well rounded and fully functioning team.</p><p>
      In order to explore my identity and values further I took the Myers-Briggs test and came away with Virtuoso (ISTP), after digesting the reading I completely agree with around 90% of the traits and qualities described, the other 10% I find that I often embody a different trait. I am an Extrovert around friends and family but an Introvert around new people. I often spend more time thinking before making a choice but I also often act on Impulse. ISTPs are touted to become mechanics or engineers, Often struggling with academic work they prefer to get stuck in with hands on learning. I have found this to be true and the exercises based on reflection I have struggled with as it all comes from within. However, not one to shy away from a challenge I wanted to dive deeper into the topic, I took the premise of the DOPE Personality test, created a spreadsheet questionnaire and sent it to my friends and family. I asked them to fill the in the questionnaire and the results were interesting to say the least! Comparing them to the answers I chose for myself I came away with a higher appreciation for the courage and honesty in the feedback I received.</p>

          <p>Deciding to leave the military was a big decision. Deciding to leave the comfort of a stable career to pursue opportunities in the wider world was scary for quite some time. Im still left with apprehension as I approach life as a full time student for the first time since college. I chose to leave as I couldn't see my career progression aligning with my goals for my future. I found that day to day I wasn't enjoying the work but because I was still getting paid I stayed ! This caused a rift between my want to remain comfortable and being honest with myself. After deciding to leave I was faced with a second decision, I knew that becoming a Developer was my next career path but which way would I choose to get there?I tossed up between university, bootcamp or self taught. While University is the traditional path and would provide opportunities to develop critical thinking methods required for the degree, a good knowledge base and a qualification which would be acknowledged far and wide, I didn't feel that it suited the way I learn. Deciding against becoming a self taught developer was also an easy choice. It would give me the freedom to study the way I wanted and be as hands on as I could, but I still feel the need for a structured. As disciplined as I am, academic work has always been something that I have struggled with and I feel that it ultimately wouldn't have worked out. The final option I regarded, much to the dismay of my father, a University Professor and career academic, was Dev Academy. Choosing this course was, for me, the best of both worlds. Hands on and structured, while also having a focus on introducing me to the real world dynamic of being a developer.

<!-- Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity -->
Growing up in New Zealand has definitely influenced the way I approach the world and the people in it. New Zealanders are mostly a happy and diverse bunch, and they are the qualities that I resonate with. Throughout my childhood we always had a full house, whether is was family or friends, the happiest memories I have are from parties, gatherings or just being around people. From that to the teamwork focussed culture of the military, I thrive in group situations and feel that I work best in when presented with a task that requires input from others. Having two very hard working and strong willed parents has shown me the value of both qualities, without a shadow of a doubt. I have never been content with sitting around and letting opportunities pass by without at least giving it a try. This is what drove me to having 3 part time jobs by the time I was 18. 

<!-- Describe your strengths and limitations through explaining a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make -->
Choosing my next career path was something I spent most of 2020 mulling over, I have been a qualified Personal Trainer for several years and have always had a passion for health and fitness. On the flip side, I have had a passion for technology since a very young age. I have an analytical mind which serves me well when approaching problems but I am limited by my selective attention span. If I am doing something I enjoy, I will happily let the day go by but if not, it might take a week. Deciding to study and become a Web Developer better suited my long term goals of being able to travel and work from essentially anywhere in the world and it also matched my skill set. Health and Fitness will always be a part of my life and with the world heading in the technology reliant direction im sure i'll be able to better integrate Personal Training into my future.


<!-- Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development -->
During my years in the military I developed my soft skills, mental flexibility and management skills. These strengths make me a good fit for any team based work. In approaching this new learning journey there have already been times where my persistence on pursuing certain topics has put me behind which triggers my competitive spirit. I normally seek feedback on the work I do but I often find it difficult to take constructive criticism and turn it into something positive, which is something I have committed to working on. 

<!-- Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles -->


<!-- Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why -->

<div Myers Briggs>
  Myers-Briggs - Virtuoso (ISTP)
  Strengths & Weaknesses
  <!-- Strengths -->
  Optimistic and Energetic –
  Virtuosos are usually up to their elbows in some project or other. Cheerful and good-natured, people with the Virtuoso personality type (especially Assertive ones) rarely get stressed out, preferring to go with the flow.
  Creative and Practical –
  Virtuosos are very imaginative when it comes to practical things, mechanics, and crafts. Novel ideas come easily, and they love using their hands to put them into action.
  Spontaneous and Rational –
  Combining spontaneity with logic, Virtuosos can switch mindsets to fit new situations with little effort, making them flexible and versatile individuals.
  Know How to Prioritize –
  This flexibility comes with some unpredictability, but Virtuoso personalities are able to store their spontaneity for a rainy day, releasing their energy just when it’s needed most.
  Great in a Crisis –
  With all this hands-on creativity and spontaneity, it’s no wonder that Virtuosos are naturals in crisis situations. People with this personality type usually enjoy a little physical risk, and they aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty when the situation calls for it.
  Relaxed –
  Through all this, Virtuosos are able to stay quite relaxed. They live in the moment and go with the flow, refusing to worry too much about the future.
  <!-- Weaknesses -->
  Stubborn –
  As easily as Virtuosos go with the flow, they can also ignore it entirely, and usually move in another direction with little apology or sensitivity. If someone tries to change Virtuosos’ habits, lifestyle or ideas through criticism, they can become quite blunt in their irritation.
  Insensitive –
  Virtuosos use logic, and even when they try to meet others halfway with empathy and emotional sensitivity, it rarely seems to quite come out right, if anything is even said at all.
  Private and Reserved –
  Virtuoso personalities are notoriously difficult to get to know. They are true introverts, keeping their personal matters to themselves, and often just prefer silence to small talk.
  Easily Bored –
  Virtuosos enjoy novelty, which makes them excellent tinkerers, but much less reliable when it comes to focusing on things long-term. Once something is understood, Virtuosos tend to simply move on to something new and more interesting.
  Dislike Commitment –
  Long-term commitments are particularly onerous for Virtuosos. They prefer to take things day-by-day, and the feeling of being locked into something for a long time is downright oppressive. This can be a particular challenge in Virtuosos’ romantic relationships.
  Risky Behavior –
  This stubbornness, difficulty with others’ emotions, focus on the moment, and easy boredom can lead to unnecessary and unhelpful boundary-pushing, just for fun. Virtuosos have been known to escalate conflict and danger just to see where it goes, something that can have disastrous consequences for everyone around if they lose control of the situation.
