            <h3><b>EQ vs IQ</b></h3>

            <h4 class="cardTitle">What is Emotional Intelligence or EQ </h4>

            <p>
                Emotional Intelligence (EI or EQ) is a way of measuring a persons connection to their emotions, to their
                body and to their mind. It differs from general Intelligence (IQ) in a way where, someone can have the
                highest IQ in the world but no EQ. This person
                with no EQ would struggle to relate to others or work in a team, they wouldn't know how to deal with
                failure or adapt to change. Having a low EQ is quite often defined as immaturity.

                <li>Self-awareness - <br> Being able to recognize your own emotions and hwo they affect your thoughts

            <h4 class="cardTitle">Why is EQ/EI so important</h4>

            <p>
                Having Emotional Intelligence allows individuals to better connect with themselves and also with each
                other, forming lasting and effective bonds or teams. Examples of where someone has a high IQ but low EQ
                can be seen in the TV shows, House M.D or Sherlock.
                Throughout the series the main character often feels alienated from the people around them and "chooses"
                to be alone. This is indicative of not having the emotional intelligence needed to form a relationship
                built on something other than work.
            </p>

            <p>
                Emotional Intelligence can also have an impact on your physical and mental health. Not having control of
                your emotions can cause stress, which can cause things like high blood pressure, which in turn can lead
                to strokes, blood clots or even cardiac arrest.
                Left alone stress can also lead to mental health issues such as anxiety or depression. This is why it is
                so important to learn to control and manage your emotions and really get to know your body and how you
                are really feeling!
