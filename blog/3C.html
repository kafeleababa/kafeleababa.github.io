        <h4 class="cardtitle">What is Emotional Intelligence or EQ </h4>
        <p>
            Emotional Intelligence (EI or EQ) is a way of measuring a persons connection to their emotions, to their body and to their mind. It differs from general Intelligence (IQ) in a way where, someone can have the highest IQ in the world but no EQ. This person
            with no EQ would struggle to relate to others or work in a team, they wouldn't know how to deal with failure or adapt to change. Having a low EQ is quite often defined as immaturity.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: none; font-size: 20px;">EQ is commonly defined by 4 attributes:</li>
            <li>Self-management - <br> The ability to control impulsive feelings and behaviors, manage emotions in healthy ways, take initiative, follow through on commitments and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances.</li>
            <li>Self-awareness - <br> Being able to recognize your own emotions and hwo they affect your thoughts and behavior. You can identify your strengths and weaknesses and have self confidence.</li>
            <li>Social awareness - <br> Having empathy. Understanding the emotions, needs and concerns of others. Being able to pick up on emotional clues, feel comfortable in social settings and being able to recognize the power dynamics in a group or company.</li>
            <li>Relationship management - <br> Developing and maintaining healthy lasting relationships, having clear communication, inspiring and influencing others, working well in teams and being able to manage conflict.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="cardtitle">Why is EQ/EI so important</h4>
        <p>
            Having Emotional Intelligence allows individuals to better connect with themselves and also with each other, forming lasting and effective bonds or teams. Examples of where someone has a high IQ but low EQ can be seen in the TV shows, House M.D or Sherlock.
            Throughout the series the main character often feels alienated from the people around them and "chooses" to be alone. This is indicative of not having the emotional intelligence needed to form a relationship built on something other than work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Emotional Intelligence can also have an impact on your physical and mental health. Not having control of your emotions can cause stress, which can cause things like high blood pressure, which in turn can lead to strokes, blood clots or even cardiac arrest.
            Left alone stress can also lead to mental health issues such as anxiety or depression. This is why it is so important to learn to control and manage your emotions and really get to know your body and how you are really feeling!
