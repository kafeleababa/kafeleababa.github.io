        <h3><b>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</b></h3>

        <h4 class="cardTitle">What is Neuroplasticity</h4>

        <p>
            Neuroplasticity is a long and scary word but essentially it is the idea that our brains aren't fixed and unable to change. Its the idea that over time, with practice both mentally and physically, we can change the way our brains are wired. To a certain
            extent. It is often stipulated that kids brains are like sponges, soaking up all and any information given, and by the time we reach adulthood we no longer possess that 'sponge like brain'. Neuroplasticity challenges that idea, our brains
            are designed to adapt to our surroundings and to new information and experiences. As we get older though, we tend to solidify our surroundings. Never needing to adapt, never needing to change, which can cause difficulty when entering a new
            situation. Like entering full time study 6 years after leaving college!
        </p>
        <p>
            As we have progressed through these first 4 weeks of our journey, our wiring in our brains has adapted to the deluge of new information and subtle changes have taken place. From day one, not knowing anything about what a console or terminal is, to now
            zipping around directories using only a keyboard. This is Neuroplasticity in practice, through the exposure of new information and daily practice using that new information, our brains have formed new neural pathways that previously never
            existed!

            There are many ways to implement the concept of Neuroplasticity and here are some favorites:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3 class = 'cardTitle'>Sleeping</h3>
                Getting plenty of sleep has always been touted as one of the best recovery methods for the body and for good reason. Sleep not only supports the body's physical recovery but it also helps with learning and memory retention.</li>
            <li>
                <h3 class = 'cardTitle'>Reading</h3>
                Reading stimulates the brain in many ways and can increase your vocabulary (Depending on what you read of course)</li>
            <li>
                <h3 class = 'cardTitle'>Switching hands</h3>
                Using your non-dominant hand for everyday activities, brushing your teeth, using your mouse or even writing will help your brain form new neural connections</li>
            <li>
                <h3 class = 'cardTitle'>Brain Training games</h3>
                While it seems a little on the nose, Brain Training has been tested and proven to help with improving mental performance.<br> An app that I enjoy using: <a href="https://elevateapp.com/"><u>Elevate</u> Brain Training</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="cardTitle">Growth vs Fixed mindset</h4>
            <p>
                What does it mean to have a Fixed mind. A Fixed mind is often stubborn, unwilling to accept challenge or give up when faced with obstacles. They see themselves as not needing to change but that the problem is wrong or the solution unobtainable. The idea
                that, you are as good as you'll ever be is what limits a Fixed Mind. The ability to adapt to change is what makes us human and is why humanity is where it is today. This is where the Growth Mindset comes into play. The Growth Mindset is
                willing to change, they welcome challenge and they persist on to overcome obstacles. They see mistakes as an opportunity to learn and improve.
            </p>
            <div class="img">

            <p>
                In researching the different mindsets we posses, I learned that it is common to have both a fixed mind and a growth mind. A fixed mind when it comes to the values you hold but a growth mindset when it comes to learning something new. I believe I possess
                mostly a Growth Mindset, but there are definitely things I struggle with and am working on changing. I have always maintained that i'm bad at maths therefore I will struggle with programming, and while there have definitely been moments
                of frustration on this journey, there have also been breakthroughs in my understanding. These breakthroughs have shown me that it is all possible as long as I approach it in a manner that works for me.
