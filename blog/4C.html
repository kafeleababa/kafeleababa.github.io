        <h3><b>Neuroplasticity</b></h3>
        <h4 class="cardtitle">What is Neuroplasticity</h4>
        <p>
            Neuroplasticity is a long and scary word but essentially it is the embodiment of the 'practice makes
            perfect' mindset. Not only does physically doing something repeatedly improve the wiring in your brain
            relating to that activity, studies have shown that mental practice or reflection can also fire the same
            neurons.</p>
        <p> Using an example from a study, half of a group were allowed to physically practice on a piano for 2 hours a
            day while the other half were only allowed to mentally practice for 2 hours day. The study showed that after
            3 days of practice the accuracy of performance of both groups were the same! After another 2 days the
            physical group began to pull ahead of the others, but when the mental group were given the opportunity to
            physically practice, they quickly caught up. This is proof that the idea of Neuroplasticity can have a
            marked effect on performance. Practice can be as much <b>Mental</b> as it is <b>Physical</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to better understand and implement the concept of Neuroplasticity, there are 3 suggested methods:
        </p><ul>
            <li>Daily Practice</li>
            <li>Putting new information in context.</li>
            <li>Understand that this is how the brain is designed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As much as humans are creatures of habit, we can just as easily create new ones or break off bad ones using Neuroplasticity.

        <h4 class="cardtitle">Growth vs Fixed mindset</h4>
        <p>
            What does it mean to have a Fixed mind. A Fixed mind is often stubborn, unwilling to accept challenge or give up when faced with obstacles.  They see themselves as not needing to change but that the problem is wrong or the solution unobtainable. The idea that, you are as good as you'll ever be is what limits a Fixed Mind. The ability to adapt to change is what makes us human and is why humanity is where it is today. This is where the Growth Mindset comes into play. The Growth Mindset is willing to change, they welcome challenge and they persist on to overcome obstacles. They see mistakes as an opportunity to learn and improve.
