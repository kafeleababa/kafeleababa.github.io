        <h3><b>End of Foundations Reflections</b></h3>
        <h4 class="cardtitle">What are 3 new things you've learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning</h4>
        <p>
            I have learned many things about myself over the course of Foundations. I know that I enjoy understanding new things and new concepts but, when I came across barriers or obstacles I tended to get frustrated because I had stopped making progress. I learned
            that I find it easier to ask for help than to put more effort into working the problem out. I would rather understand the answer than figure out how to work out the answer myself.
        </p>

        <h4 class="cardtitle">What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
        <p>
            Having values, having empathy and being self aware are all part of becoming a better person in general, not just a programmer. In the programmer world however, these qualities are essential as being a part of a team is almost guaranteed these days. Working
            with other people and working with yourself. Being self aware and taking stock of your own strengths and limits makes you a stronger person.
        </p>
        <h4 class="cardtitle">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
        <p>
            Writing the reflections has probably been the least looked forward to part of each week, but the most rewarding at the end of the day. It was never something that I thought I would regularly do as I didn't really believe that I would benefit from it.
        </p>
        <h4 class="cardtitle">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
        <p>
            Sticking to my own schedule was my challenge. From week 3 onwards I would set up a rough timetable for each day based on the time-boxes and try and work within them. I found that I quickly fell out of this routine when the technical challenges started
            to outpace my understanding. Because of this I ended up playing catchup and the core exercises would take a backseat, often taking up my Saturday.
        </p>
        <h4 class="cardtitle">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h4>
        <p>
            There are stereotypes in society around programmers being loners and isolating from other people and society. In the modern day programmers work in teams more often than other jobs. As the majority of us who graduate from the academy wont already have
            any relevant degrees, being able to market yourself as having, not only the technical skills needed to do the job but also the soft skills needed to fit into any team, I see it as a bonus.
        </p>
        <h4 class="cardtitle">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
        <p>
            As I mentioned above, leaving the academy with the soft skills that university graduates might not have developed will put us in a different light to employers. I also feel that any opportunity to become a better human is never wasted time.
