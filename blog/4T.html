        <h3><b>Problem Solving</b></h3>
        
        <p>
            After scouring the web, reading article after article all relating to 'life as a programmer', problem solving is the bulk of the job. Most developers seem to spend more time debugging than writing code. This is a reality that throughout this course I have come to see as my reality. I have come up against multiple problems related to the application of Javascript concepts. When faced with these problems the techniques I employ include a combination of Googling, trying different things, Console.logging and finally asking my peers in the developer community. I don't ask for the answer, rather for an explanation of the concept in terms I can understand.

        <h4 class="cardtitle">A Simple Problem</h4>
        <p>
            This week the focus has been problem solving and testing and throughout has caused me to employ all of my techniques, sometimes simultaneously! The problem I spent the most time on this week involved using Built in Methods for strings and arrays. While simple in concept, the application of these new techniques in concert with each other stumped me. I used the aforementioned problem solving techniques with dwindling results, I got more of an understanding of each of the concepts but still no grand solution for the problem. I eventually tried a combination of Pseudocode and trying multiple approaches. While I got the solution in the end, I couldn't help but feel frustrated during the process.

            The Scooby Do challenge. Solving this problem took the better part of an afternoon but at the end of it all, I smile when looking back at it. It started, as most of these challenges have, with reading the problem, reading the tests and then diving straight in with an attempt! I usually copy the function I need to write and test outputs to <a href = "www.codepen.io">CodePen</a> and use the live console to see what is happening as I write each line. I made it to Test 3 before I started Googling and it took a little while but eventually I stumbled onto the right video. In it, the method I needed to employ was broken down and explained step by step which greatly improved my understanding. I took my new knowledge and successfully applied it to the problem.

            Feeling particularly smug with my 7 line solution, I sent my code to some developer friends and asked them if there was a more concise way to do it. After receiving an answer with only 4 lines which used <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining?fbclid=IwAR1DRm3EmLM1QNZ1iqb6HEutS0lbpr6v8nF9bGwdQMVo3uxYboSlDUFo538">Optional Chaining</a>, I realized that, even though I had an answer that worked, there is almost always a better way to do things and I look forward to learning them!
