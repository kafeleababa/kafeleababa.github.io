      <h3><b>My Learning Plan.</b></h3>
      <h4 class="cardtitle">What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h4>
      <p>
        My motivation for becoming a web developer stems from my passion for technology, problem solving and freedom to work remotely. The tech industry is changing everyday and being a part of that change and growth is exciting.

      <h4 class="cardtitle">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h4>
      <p>
        I want to develop my soft skills to become more well rounded and learn how to better keep to a schedule.

      <h4 class="cardtitle">A description of your own strengths and limitations</h4>
      <p>
        I am a very driven and persistant, I have experience with managing small teams and I enjoy hard work. However I can often be easily distracted and my persistant nature can also be unhelpful, I tend to dwell when I get stuck rather than take steps to break the problem down.

      <h4 class="cardtitle">Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h4>
      <p>
        As this is my journey to my next career, and I have essentially "Put all my eggs in one basket", I plan to approach the coming months as if my future depends on it! This means not only working hard, but working smart. Planning out my days, making sure I take the time to step back and reflect, making sure I get plenty of rest and also exercising three times a week minimum and eating healthty.

    <div class="card">
      <h4 class="cardtitle">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h4>
      <p>
        If I find myself stuck on a topic, I will make sure I will spend no longer than 20-30mins on it myself. In that time I will employ the problem solving skills we have been developing and, if that turns up no results I will turn to my fellow students, then to the facilitators either through Slack or Zoom.

      <h4 class="cardtitle">A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h4>
      <p>
        I see the facilitaion team as my safety net, I understand the reason why the course is set up the way it is. Not treating the facilitators as only teachers or lecturers, but as colleagues with subject matter expertise who I can turn to in a pinch whether it be work related or personal.

      <h4 class="cardtitle">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</h4>
      <p>
        As I mentioned earlier, this course is my main focus and I plan to treat it like a full time job. Once I am happy with the work I have done each day, I can move my attention to, Spending time with my partner, my friends and also myself.
