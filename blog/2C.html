            <h3><b>My Bootcamp Learning Plan.</b></h3>
            <h4 class="cardtitle">What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h4>
            <p>
                I still don't have a specific plan or company I want to join at the end of Bootcamp, but I hope that I can use the skills I gain to join a team in which I can up-skill as much as possible. The tech industry is forever changing and the more opportunities
                I have to stay at the relevant end of things, the better.
            </p>


            <h4 class="cardtitle">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>
            <p>
                I think that during Bootcamp that my technical knowledge will be challenged more than my human skills. I'm confident in my ability to work well with others but I also know that there is always room for improvement. I hope that I continue to grow my soft
                skills, at least as much as my technical skills grow. I have grown to learn over these 5 weeks that I find it easy to get inside my own head when I get stuck, quickly spiralling to thoughts of not being capable of becoming a programmer.
                I know that these thoughts can be destructive and ultimately unhelpful and learning to control an ignore these thoughts will be paramount during Bootcamp.
            </p>


            <h4 class="cardtitle">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>
            <p>
                My biggest non-technical challenge will be managing my time and keeping to a healthy routine as much as possible.
            </p>


            <h4 class="cardtitle">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
            </h4>
            <p>
                I would like to continue to grow personally. I know that I struggle with taking constructive feedback so the more I practice it the better ill get.
            </p>


            <h4 class="cardtitle">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
            <p>
                I expect the Bootcamp team to act as they have thus far. Being there as a support and safety net. Engaging with the cohorts and providing us with the knowledge and opportunities to grow
            </p>


            <h4 class="cardtitle">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>
            <p>
                I expect that there will be many times where I get stuck during these next 9 weeks. As the setup of the Bootcamp is slightly different to Foundations, having access to the fellow students and facilitators will be easier. So when i find myself stuck i
                will first try and work through a solution either by myself or my work partner and then turn to the facilitators. I expect that there will be many challenges ahead but as my future is somewhat dependant on my success during this course
                I will make it work and I will find a way!

            <h3><b>My Foundations Learning Plan.</b></h3>
            <h4 class="cardtitle">What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h4>
            <p>
                My motivation for becoming a web developer stems from my passion for technology, problem solving and freedom to work remotely. The tech industry is changing everyday and being a part of that change and growth is exciting.
            </p>
            <h4 class="cardtitle">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h4>
            <p>
                I want to develop my soft skills to become more well rounded and learn how to better keep to a schedule.
            </p>

            <h4 class="cardtitle">A description of your own strengths and limitations</h4>
            <p>
                I am a very driven and persistant, I have experience with managing small teams and I enjoy hard work. However I can often be easily distracted and my persistant nature can also be unhelpful, I tend to dwell when I get stuck rather than take steps to break
                the problem down.
            </p>

            <h4 class="cardtitle">Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and
                industry/community representatives.
            </h4>
            <p>
                As this is my journey to my next career, and I have essentially "Put all my eggs in one basket", I plan to approach the coming months as if my future depends on it! This means not only working hard, but working smart. Planning out my days, making sure
                I take the time to step back and reflect, making sure I get plenty of rest and also exercising three times a week minimum and eating healthty.
            </p>

            <h4 class="cardtitle">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h4>
            <p>
                If I find myself stuck on a topic, I will make sure I will spend no longer than 20-30mins on it myself. In that time I will employ the problem solving skills we have been developing and, if that turns up no results I will turn to my fellow students, then
                to the facilitators either through Slack or Zoom.
            </p>

            <h4 class="cardtitle">A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h4>
            <p>
                I see the facilitation team as my safety net, I understand the reason why the course is set up the way it is. Not treating the facilitators as only teachers or lecturers, but as colleagues with subject matter expertise who I can turn to in a pinch whether
                it be work related or personal.
            </p>
            </p>

            <h4 class="cardtitle">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.</h4>
            <p>
                As I mentioned earlier, this course is my main focus and I plan to treat it like a full time job. Once I am happy with the work I have done each day, I can move my attention to, Spending time with my partner, my friends and also myself.
